ToDoro is a minimalist productivity tool that is designed to be user friendly and functional at the same time.

There are three components to this web-application (for now):

1.Pomodoro Timer
    This time is designed to be an automated pomodoro timer for users to use where once you press starts, the timer goes on for 25 minutes (work time), and at the end of that period, another timer begins for 5 minutes (rest time)
    This cycle continues over and over until the user is done working for the day. This method of studying has been continuously shown and proven to be effecive to maximize the quality of ones studying!
    
2. Todo list
    The main page leads you to your todo list where you can easily add tasks and categorize them based on urgency and the category under which the task falls (lifestlye, school, work, etc)
    There is also a filter tool implemented which the user can use to show tasks pertaining to a given category, or urgency level.
    
3. Study Tips
    This part of the web-application is meant to be more informative, and give effective study tips that have been backed by several studies.
    
4. Register/login
    Users are required to create and use individualized accounts to use this application which allows for a more unique experience to be created.
